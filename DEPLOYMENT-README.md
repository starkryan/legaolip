# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Database Configuration for Supabase

The application has been configured to work with Supabase's transaction pooler for Vercel deployment. Here's how to set it up properly:

### Environment Variables

You need to set these environment variables in your Vercel project:

#### 1. Database URLs
```bash
# Primary database connection (for migrations and direct queries)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.kshpbvbbphpdilhmpozk:Lauda@979892@aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres

# Transaction pooler URL (for serverless functions)
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres.kshpbvbbphpdilhmpozk:Lauda@979892@aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

#### 2. Authentication
```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
```

### Supabase Connection Details

The configuration uses:

- **Port 5432**: Direct connection for database operations
- **Port 6543**: Transaction pooler for serverless functions

This setup resolves the "prepared statement does not exist" errors that occur when using connection poolers with Prisma.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push Schema to Production**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel**
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add all the variables listed above

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Troubleshooting

#### If you get "prepared statement already exists" errors:
- Ensure you're using the correct DATABASE_URL (port 5432 for direct connection)
- The application is configured to handle pooler limitations

#### If database connection fails:
- Verify your Supabase credentials are correct
- Check that your IP is whitelisted in Supabase
- Ensure the database is accessible from Vercel's network

### API Endpoints

After deployment, these endpoints will be available:

- `POST /api/device/register` - Register new devices
- `POST /api/device/heartbeat` - Update device status
- `GET /api/devices` - List all devices
- `POST /api/sms/receive` - Receive SMS messages
- `GET /api/sms` - Get SMS messages

### Monitoring

Check your Vercel function logs for any database connection issues. The application now includes proper error handling for connection pooler limitations.

## Production Considerations

1. **Database Security**: Use environment-specific secrets
2. **Connection Limits**: Monitor Supabase connection usage
3. **Performance**: The transaction pooler helps with serverless function scaling
4. **Backup**: Ensure Supabase backups are configured

The application is now fully compatible with Vercel's serverless environment and Supabase's transaction pooler.
